# MyNN (needs a new name)
A pure-Python neural network library based on the amazing
[MyGrad](https://github.com/rsokl/MyGradhttps://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad).

`mynn` (god that's bad) was created as an extension to `mygrad` for rapid prototyping of
neural networks with minimal dependencies, a clean code base with excellent documentation,
and as a learning tool.

## Installation Instructions
If you already have MyGrad installed, clone MyNN, navigate to the resulting directory, and
run

``` shell
python setup.py develop
```

If you don't have MyGrad installed, then you can run

*add setup instructions once we figure this out*

## Quickstart
Put in a nice, small example here.
